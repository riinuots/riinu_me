<p><strong><em>TLDR:</em></strong> For high quality images in HTML and Word outputs change your DPI setting to 200 or 300.</p>
<p>The default DPI of figures created by R Markdown or Quarto for HTML and Word outputs is 96 (dots per inch - resolution). This may be sufficient for web purposes (HTML), but not sufficient for publishing manuscripts (Word). PDFs include vector graphics and are therefore infinite resolution.</p>
<p>In <strong>R Markdown</strong>, DPI can be changed in the set-up chunk, by including <code>knitr::opts_chunk$set(dpi = 300)</code> in the set-up chunk:</p>
<p><img src="/img/dpi_rmarkdown.png" fig-alt="Changing the DPI of R Markdown by setting dpi=300 in the set-up chunk." /></p>
<p>And in <strong>Quarto</strong> the same can be achieved by including <code>fig-dpi: 300</code> in the YAML:</p>
