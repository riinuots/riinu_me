TLDR: there are two new and very intuitive R functions for reshaping data: see [Examples](#examples) of `pivot_longer()` and `pivot_wider()` below. At the time of writing, these new functions are extremely fresh and only exist in the development version on GitHub (see [Installation](#installation)), we should probably wait for the tidyverse team to officially release them (in CRAN) before putting them into day-to-day use.

Exciting!

# Introduction

The juxtapose of *data collection* vs *data analysis*: data that was very easy to collect, is probably very hard to analyse, and vice versa. For example, if data is collected/written down whichever format was most convenient at the time of data collection, it is probably not recorded in a regularly shaped table, with various bits of information in different parts of the document. And even if data is collected into a table, it is often intuitive (for data entry) to include information about the same variable in different columns. For example, look at this example data I just made up:



```{r, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

candydata_raw = read_csv("2019-04-07_candy_preference_data.csv")

```


```{r, echo = FALSE}

candydata_raw %>% 
  knitr::kable()

```

For each candy type, there are 8 columns with values. But actually, these 8 columns capture a combination of 3 variables: `age`, `likes` and `eats`. This is known as the wide format, and it is a convenient way to either note down or even present values. It is human-readable. For effective data analysis, however, we need data to be in the tidy data format, where each column is a single variable, and each row a single observation (https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v059i10). It needs to be less human-readable and more computer-friendly. 


Some of you may remember now retired `reshape2::melt()` or `reshape2::dcast()`, and many of you (inclduing myself!) have struggled remebering the arguments for `tidyr::gather()` and `tidyr::spread()`. Based on extensive community feedback, the tidyverse team have reinveted these functions using both more intuitive names, as well as clearer syntax (arguments):

```{r echo=FALSE}
blogdown::shortcode('tweet', '1109816130774986753')
```

# Installation {#installation20190407}

These functions were added just a month ago, so these functions are not yet included in the standard version of `tidyr` that comes with `install.packages("tidyverse")` or even `update.packages()` (the current version of `tidyr` on CRAN is 0.8.3). To play with the bleeding edge versions of R packages, run `install.packages("devtools")` and then `devtools::install_github("tidyverse/tidyr")`. If you are a Mac user and it asks you "Do you want to install from sources the package which needs compilation?", say Yes.


You might need to Restart R (Session menu at the top) and load `library(tidyverse)` again. You can check whether you now have these functions installed by typing in `pivot_longer` and pressing F1 - if a relevant Help tab pops open you got it.



# Examples {#examples20190407}

```{r}

candydata_longer = candydata_raw %>% 
  pivot_longer(contains("age"))

```


```{r, echo = FALSE}

candydata_longer %>% 
  knitr::kable()

```



Now, that's already a lot better, but we still need to split the `name` column into the two different variables it really includes. "name" is what `pivot_longer()` calls this new column by default. Remember, each column is a single variable.


```{r}

candydata_longer = candydata_raw %>% 
  pivot_longer(contains("age")) %>% 
  separate(name, into = c("questions", NA, "age"), convert = TRUE)

```

```{r, echo = FALSE}

candydata_longer %>% 
  knitr::kable()

```


And `pivot_wider()` can be used to do the reverse:

```{r}

candydata = candydata_longer %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = questions, values_from = value)

```


```{r, echo = FALSE}

candydata %>% 
  knitr::kable()

```

It is important to spell out the arguments here (`names_from = `, `values_frame = `) since they are not  the second and third arguments of `pivot_wider()` (like they were in `spread()`). Investigate the `pivot_wider+F1` Help tab for more information.


# Wrap-up and notes

Now these are datasets we can work with: each column is a variable, each row is an observation.

Do not start replacing working and tested instances of `gather()` or `spread()` in your existing R code with these new functions. That is neither efficient nor necessary - `gather()` and `spread()` will remain in `tidyr` to make sure people's scripts don't suddenly stop working. Meaning: `tidyr` is backward compatible. But after these functions are officially released, I will start using them in all new scripts I write.

I made the original messy columns still relatively nice to work with - no typos and reasonable delimiters. Usually, the labels are much worse and need the help of `janitor::clean_names()`, `stringr::str_replace()`, and multiple iterations of `tidyr::separate()` to arrive at a nice tidy tibble/data frame.

## tidyr::separate() tips:

`into = c("var1", NA, "var2")` - now this is an amazing trick I only came across this week! This is a convenient way to drop useless (new) columns. Previously, I would have achieved the same result with:
```
... %>% 
    separate(..., into = c("var1", "drop", "var2")) %>% 
    select(-drop) %>% 
    ...
    
```

`convert = TRUE`: by default, `separate()` creates new variables that are also just "characters". This means our age would have been a chacter vector of, e.g., "5", "10", rather than 5, 10, and R wouldn't have known how to do arithmetic on it. In this example, `convert = TRUE` is equivalent to `mutate(age = as.numeric(age))`.

Good luck!

P.S. This is one of the coolest Tweets I've ever seen:

```{r echo=FALSE}
blogdown::shortcode('tweet', '1112675046663876608')
```
