***TLDR:*** For high quality images in HTML and Word outputs change your DPI setting to 200 or 300.


The default DPI of figures created by R Markdown or Quarto for HTML and Word outputs is 96 (dots per inch - resolution). This may be sufficient for web purposes (HTML), but not sufficient for publishing manuscripts (Word). PDFs include vector graphics and are therefore infinite resolution.

In **R Markdown**, DPI can be changed in the set-up chunk, by including `knitr::opts_chunk$set(dpi = 300)` in the set-up chunk:

![](/img/dpi_rmarkdown.png){fig-alt="Changing the DPI of R Markdown by setting dpi=300 in the set-up chunk."}

And in **Quarto** the same can be achieved by including `fig-dpi: 300` in the YAML:

![](/img/dpi_quarto.png){fig-alt="Changing the DPI of Quarto by setting dpi-fig: 300 in the YAML."}
