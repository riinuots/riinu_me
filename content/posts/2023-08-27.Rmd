I've put together a quick 'getting started with Quarto and Netlify and GitHub (optional) workshop'.

The instructions can be found in the blog post below, or at this website which also includes short screencasts: https://quarto-workshop.netlify.app

## What is Quarto?

-   Quarto^®^ is an open-source scientific and technical publishing system built on Pandoc

-   [https://quarto.org/](https://quarto.org/){target="_blank"}

-   Colloquially known as the 'new R Markdown'

## Prerequisites

-   Install the latest version of RStudio Desktop on your computer (from July 2022, Quarto is included with RStudio)

    -   [https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download){target="_blank"}

-   Install the latest version of R on your computer

    -   [https://cloud.r-project.org/](https://cloud.r-project.org/){target="_blank"}

Workshop versions: R *4.2.1*, RStudio *2022.07.1*.

**Note:** Quarto can be used without R or RStudio, e.g., with VS Code. But this workshop demonstrates the use of RStudio and includes some R code.


# 1. Create a new Quarto website project

-   RStudio - New Project - New Directory - Quarto Website

-   Click on Render to have a look at the template.

## Troubleshooting

-   Error: "C:/Program is not recognised as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file."
    -   Make sure the project name and parent folders have no spaces in them (only an issue on some Windows computers).
-   "Quarto Website" is not listed as an option.
    -   Make sure your RStudio is version 2022.07.1 or greater.

# 2. Edit your Quarto website

-   Change the theme in `_quarto.yml` to anything other than the default.
-   Edit the template content in `index.qmd` and `about.qmd`.

# 3. Add a page to your website

-   Take a copy of an existing page, e.g., `about.qmd`. Call it `penguins.qmd`.
-   Edit the title and content of `penguins.qmd`.
-   Add it to `_quarto.yml`.

# 4. Add R code to your website

-   Insert a code chunk.
    -   Use the green **+C** button or `Ctrl+Alt+I`/`Cmd+Opt+I`.
-   Add in R code, for example:

```
#| eval: false
library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)

penguins %>% 
  ggplot(aes(species, flipper_length_mm, fill = sex, size = body_mass_g)) +
  geom_jitter(shape = 21, colour = "grey", alpha = 0.8) +
  scale_fill_viridis_d() +
  theme_bw()
```

-   Hide the R code and its warnings.
    -   Search online for 'quarto output options' to copy the relevant YAML options.

    -   Displaying code is referred to as 'echo'.
    
# 5. Serve your website using Netlify

-   Find the project and its `_site` directory on your computer.
    -   The Files tab within RStudio shows you the project path. Locate this folder in File Explorer (Windows) or Finder (macOS).
-   Search online for 'netlify drop'
-   Drag and drop the `_site` folder there.

## Optional: If want to keep the site for longer than 1h

-   Create a Netlify account (GitHub authentication is convenient). Claim the site.

-   Give it a better URL, e.g., yourname.netlify.app.

    -   Site settings - General - Change site name.

    -   FYI, custom domains, so getting rid of the trailing netlify.app cost around £20-30 per year.
    
# 6. Update your website

-   Edit your website in RStudio. Click Render.
-   In Netlify - Deploys - Drag and drop `_site` folder to the update area:

![](/img/netlify_update.png){fig-alt="Netlify site - Deploy - Drag and drop output folder to update site"}

## Optional advanced: automatic deploys via GitHub

-   If this is the first time you're using git on your computer, do these things:

    -   Install git: [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads){target="_blank"}

    -   Create a GitHub account if you don't have one already: [https://github.com/](https://github.com/){target="_blank"}

    -   RStudio, Tools, Global Options, Git/SVN, Create SSH Key.

    -   Copy the key over to your GitHub account Settings.

    -   Back in RStudio, run these lines in the Shell/Terminal (also under Tools):

`git config --global user.email "your@email.com"`

`git config --global user.name "username"`

-   Push your Quarto website project from RStudio to GitHub. Hint: Create a new repository on GitHub first.

-   Make your Netlify automatically update your website when you push to GitHub.

    -   Netlify, Site settings, Build & deploy, Link repository.

    -   Publish directory: \`\_site\`.

-   Test that it works by editing your website in RStudio, render, commit, push. Tip: for committing multiple files, \`git add .\` in the Terminal is convenient. It does the same thing as manually ticking everything in the Git tab.
