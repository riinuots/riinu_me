There's some explanation on what reshaping data in R means, why we do it, as well as the history, e.g., `melt()` vs `gather()` vs `pivot_longer()`  in a previous post: [New intuitive ways for reshaping data in R](https://www.riinu.me/2019/04/new-intuitive-ways-to-reshape-data-in-r/)

That post shows how to reshape a single variable that had been recorded/entered across multiple different columns. But if multiple different variables are recorded over multiple different columns, then this is what you might want to do:


# Example data

```{r}
# from dput():
widedata = structure(list(id = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9),
                          time_1 = c(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1),
                          time_2 = c(2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2), 
                          time_3 = c(3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3),
                          time_4 = c(4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4),
                          outcome_1 = c(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1),
                          outcome_2 = c(2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2),
                          outcome_3 = c(3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3),
                          outcome_4 = c(4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4)),
                     row.names = c(NA, -9L), class = c("tbl_df", "tbl", "data.frame"))
```

This is what it looks like:

And this is what we want it to look like:

![long data in RStudio View](/img/longdata.png)


# Simple solution

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

# pivot_longer puts everything that is not id into two columns (name and value)
# separate the variable names and stage numbers
# puts both variables back into two columns using pivot_wider()
longdata = widedata %>% 
  pivot_longer(-id) %>% 
  separate(name, into = c("name", "stage"), sep = "_") %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = "name", values_from = "value")

```

I think this is a very good solution as it's easy to understand and debug. See below for a step by step explanation of these lines.

It is, however, possible to achieve the same result just by using clever arguments inside the `pivot_longer()` (thank you Lisa for teaching me this):

# Clever solution

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# same result as above but just pivot_longer()
widedata %>% 
  pivot_longer(-id,
               names_to = c(".value", "number"),
               names_pattern = "(.+)_(.+)")

```

# Simple solution step by step

## Combine all into two columns first

`pivot_longer(-id)` combines all columns except `id` into two columns (name and value):

```{r}
widedata %>% 
  pivot_longer(-id)
```

The defaults `name` and `value` may be changed using these arguments:
```{r}
widedata %>% 
  pivot_longer(-id, names_to = "my_variables", values_to = "my_values") %>% slice(1)
```

* using `%>% slice(1)` for brevity

If you have multiple columns that you don't want collected, then it's easier to select the ones you want. In this example, it would look like this:

```{r}
widedata %>% 
  pivot_longer(matches("time|outcome")) %>% slice(1)
```

In this example dataset, `matches("time|outcome")` has the same effect as `-id`.

Search for "tidyverse select helpers" to see the various options available for selecting the variables you need ([select helpers reference](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/select.html)).

## Separate column names and numbers

```{r}
widedata %>% 
  pivot_longer(-id) %>% 
  separate(name, into = c("name", "stage"), sep = "_") %>% slice(1)
```

## pivot_wider() so that each variable has its own column

And the final step of this solution is `pivot_wider()` which takes the multiple variables that `pivot_longer()` combined into `name` and puts them into their own columns:


```{r}
widedata %>% 
  pivot_longer(-id) %>% 
  separate(name, into = c("name", "stage"), sep = "_") %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = "name", values_from = "value")
```


# What if my columns don't have delimiters (e.g., instead of `time_1, time_2,...` it's `time1, time2, ...`)

In that case I would use `mutate()` + `str_extract()`/`str_remove()`:


```{r, results='hide'}
widedata %>% 
  pivot_longer(-id) %>% 
  mutate(stage    = str_extract(name, "[:digit:]")) %>% 
  mutate(variable = str_remove(name, "_[:digit:]")) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = "name", values_from = "value")
```

The first mutate extracts the number (`"[:digit:]"`) from the column called `name` (which is the result of `pivot_longer()`), I've called the new variable that gets this number `stage` but you can call it anything. We then remove the number from `name` as it now lives in a column of its own.

This extraction is actually what the `tidyr::extract()` function is for, but it always takes me much longer to get `extract()` to work as compared to the easy to manage `mutate()` + `str_extract()`/`str_remove()` combo above.


# Final words

Reshaping data is really tricky, and your spreadsheet from hell is likely much more complicated than the simple example here. It always takes me lots of trial and error to get these things to work properly. Especially if there are irregularities in the data. You may find `janitor::clean_names()` useful, or you may need to do more cleanup using various `str_()` functions from the [stringr package](https://stringr.tidyverse.org).

Good luck!
